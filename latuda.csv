Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have had great experience so far with Latuda. I started taking 40 mg in Nov., and it worked great for about a week, then I crashed again. Dr. put it up to 80 mg and I&#039;ve been great ever since. I&#039;m afraid, though, because my sex drive has completely disappeared, and if it&#039;s the Latuda, I&#039;m going to have to go off it-and I hate to go off something that&#039;s working so well. However, I&#039;m also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it&#039;s more likely to be a side effect of that, so we&#039;re decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I&#039;m feeling really good.

Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was deeply suicidal for 15 years with repetitive suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I was at the end of my rope close to killing myself and my doctor suggested latuda. I started at 80 mg 1x a day at bed time. Suicidal thoughts and constant thoughts of my 15 year old cat constantly dying largely diminished. I have a down episode once every 6 days about where I am hopeless and negative thinking again, but that lasts only a day or two. I am not missing work any more and have no problem waking up. I can only sleep 3 hours a night though after 3 months and my doctor upped me to 120 mg. Bad decision still sleepless. Going to try to go down to 40mg to help sleep will report back with results. Xanax and unisom help sleep. Well after 6 months on""",9,25-Dec-15,33
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Latuda 80 mg for 8 months and am on no other medications for medication induced bipolar disorder which was caused by antidepressants prescribed for anxiety.  Latuda should be taken with 350 calories but when I took the medicine with food I was completely engulfed in anxiety within an hour.  Now I take it at night with no food.  I sleep for 12 hours at night and feel pretty good but am easily irritated.  I had the genetic testing which indicated that I MAY be a rapid metabolizer of this medicine so I&#039;m not sure if I am not getting enough of the medicine (because I am not taking it with food) and that is the cause of my irritability or if 80mg is causing irritability.

Latuda,Schizophrenia,"""We've heard of the Latuda 20-40 mg restlessness/sense of muscle quiver being controlled by a small .5mg Benztropine daily dosage taken with the Latuda.  Both were taken in evening as it seemed to help with sleep. I believe Benztropine may normally be given for Parkinson. This was suggested by an experienced Psychiatrist who reviewed medications looking for one that had the side effect to address and to help with the sense of muscle quiver.""",9,5-Feb-16,15
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was recently diagnosed bipolar type 2 with mostly depression episodes. I was before on citalopram for 6 months after burning out in April. Latuda has really helps with the mood swings, I'm much more happy, social and productive. It&#039;s effect is almost instant. I&#039;m on 10mg and will up to 20mg soon. The only negative effect I&#039;ve experienced with Latuda is brain fog. It&#039;s been challenging for me as I am a university student. With Citalopram I would get straight As, study long periods and memorize 200 pages in 2 days. With Latuda, I have trouble memorizing a paragraph. I also tend to forget stuff. Psychiatrist says it will get better with time. Even tho I enjoyed Citalopram, I had terrible side effects. With Latuda, none. I finally feel normal.""",8,3-Nov-17,2
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I've tried for six months and would always wake up after only 3 hours. I was great for 4 or 5 days and then would sink into deep depression and threaten family with suicide for about 2 days. . Could never get sleep under control. Made my mood swings more dramatic.

Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I recently started this medication after issues with my previous meds that lasted two and a hhalf years. Major improvements! I enjoy the clarity, the increase in motiviation (for finishing tasks and social experiences) and lack of &#039;fog&#039; that used to cloud my mind. I&#039;m a big guy, so I started on 80mg: which was way too strong. But after cutting the dose in half, I am actually looking and feeling better than I have for years; my therapist, psychiatrist, family and friends all notice an extremely postive difference and vocalize this almost every day :) 
Taking it with dinner, though, seems to cause my mental and physical energy to dissipate rapidly. I go to bed much earlier than I&#039;d like to, though.""",8,21-Nov-15,35
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Worked extremely well when I first started it at 20mg- I felt amazing good, started listening to music , became more affectionate and loving with friends and family , I was feeling so good that I started telling people out of the blue that I feel happy for first time in my life. BUT, that didn&#039;t last for very long. Over the next 4-5 weeks it completely stopped working and my old depressive symptoms of my bipolar disease came back. My doc upped the dosage to 40mg to see if I could get back to the old positive state I had before at the beginning but no dice . The higher 40mg dose gave me horrible severe anxiousness, agitation , and restlessness. Others have referred to this state of agitation as akathisia. I was climbing the walls!""",3,2-Feb-16,40
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Before I took latuda, my bipolar disorder was pretty much ruining my life. I started latuda and about 2 months later, while I was starting to feel so much better. I also noticed that I was starting to feel overwhelmed and was starting to become delusional and developed irrational fears such as being scared to even go outside for example. I stopped latuda and went back to feeling normal. I thought it might have just been me and my bipolar was starting to have a severe effect on my life again so just a few months ago I decided to try latuda again. And within a week I was starting to feel overwhelmed and delusional again. I will never take it again. While the medication was effective, the side effects were horrific.""",1,18-Dec-15,30

I developed schizophrenia when I was 16 (4 years ago) but after being on like 6 billion types of medications, this one seemed to work best..the side effects were the worst! I remember one experience clearly. I was on vacation at the beach last summer and I took a latuda pill before going out to eat with my family. It kicked in after 30 min time. All of a sudden, I began feeling extremely sleepy, dizzy, and I had EXTREME akathisia? So terrible, I couldn&#039;t explain it and to top it off, my heart was racing I was having a panic attack!

Latuda,Schizophrenia,"""Horrific experience. Was only on it for 1 week (40mg). Muddled thoughts, numb tongue, restlessness, severe insomnia, nausea.""",2,2-May-16,14
Latuda,Schizophrenia,"""First off I would like to say none of these medications are effective to me, they have never helped me in any considerable way. I was diagnosed schizophrenic but for the most part it was the anxiety controlling my life, never the hallucinations. Every medication on the market besides two or three cause an enormous amount of weight gain and intolerable side effects with no legal recourse if encountered. The pharmaceutical industry has hired many attorneys and lobbyists to destroy all liability in the event of a potential hazardous or death inducing side effect for the most part. In California it is impossible to sue a doctor (psychiatrist) who commits malpractice due to the cap on awards. It&#039;s all snake oil but with actual side effects.""",5,29-Aug-17,4
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve only been on Latuda for a week, what a difference it has made in my mood. It has lifted the depression &amp; debilitating anxiety. I take it along with Depakote &amp; Klonopin (both of which I&#039;ve been on for many years). I take it at night because it makes me sleepy. It does give me a &quot;lump in the throat&quot; sensation, for some reason, about an hour and 1/2 after I take it and that feeling lasts about 2-3 hours.  The next day it&#039;s gone.  I will talk with my psych PA about it, to see what it may be.  I haven&#039;t had this much motivation in a very long time, and it&#039;s not a manic or hypomanic feeling, I just feel like living again.  I hope it continues to work well and doesn&#039;t cause any intolerable side effects.""",9,5-May-13,88
Latuda,Schizoaffective Disorde,"""This medicine has been amazing. I was put on 40 mg at night and we changed it to 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg at night. It makes me a bit sedated during the day, but honestly this is a relief, since I&#039;m just really glad not to be so paranoid and afraid anymore. It&#039;s made the voices leave, paranoia go way down, and I don&#039;t fly off the handle over every little thing anymore. No weight gain, no increased appetite, and I don&#039;t feel dumb as a rock like I have on Risperdal or Geodon.

I feel more upbeat. I don&#039;t worry like in the past about my job. I used to think people were saying things behind my back.  I lost a few pounds. I am more focused, kind of like being on adderral.  My dosage is at the sweetspot.  I find I have to take it late before I go to sleep otherwise I will want to go to sleep. I use this in combination with Wellbutrin 300mg XL in the morning with one 450 mg of lithium and two 450 mg of lithium at night with the 120 mg of latuda.

They  have tried lithium (scary rashes that took 4 months to clear) some other ones that made me worse or rashes. Latuda is the first that has been close to the awesomeness of Wellbutrin. I have more energy, eat less, fog like state of not fully &quot;being there&quot; is gone. I feel like a different person. The first week was nauseating but that went away and lasted a half hour at a time. When I bumped up to 40mg the nausea came back.

Latuda has really stabilized me. I feel &quot;good&quot; every day, if not really good/great. I have energy, but not manic/frenzied/restless. &quot;Good mood&quot; for me always carried the additional symptom of manic/tormenting agitation.

My moods are great and any irritability I experience subsides quickly. I have had no psychotic thoughts or actions since I started the Latuda. Even better, it has barely any side effects.

I was prescribed zofran to offset the nausea but that is not so helpful either since the zofran causes constipation.

I was in a deep depression, so even within weeks of taking Latuda, I didn&#039;t feel that much better. Once my doc switched me to 80 mg, I slowly started climbing out of my depression. It was a slow recovery, but it worked. I am now 80% depression-symptom free and I feel like I&#039;m back to my old self. I am able to function much better at work and life in general. I had restlessness as a side-effect for some time, but it slowly went away. I usually take Latuda before bedtime and haven&#039;t experienced any other side effects.""",9,21-Oct-16,51
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I took latuda for a little over a year and I had so many side effects. I was so tired all the time, I couldn&#039;t function at work and I was a cashier, my throat got smaller, I would gag brushing my teeth and I used to be able to take 3 pills at once without a problem. When I was on latuda I could barely swallow one and I still gagged. I had memory loss, weight gain. I was miserable and I couldn&#039;t figure out why. Then I realised that it was latuda. So, I got weaned off of it and I felt 10 million times better, I lost 50lbs since I&#039;ve been off of it, I can function again, my memory is slowly coming back and I don&#039;t gag when I brush my teeth and I can swallow more than one pill without gagging.""",1,13-Sep-17,13
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Latuda 40mg since January 2012. I was prescribed it to help me sleep because I suffer with a severe case of insomnia. I had tried many different types of medicines to help knock me out. My Dr had tried Saphris but I was experiencing all the severe side effects. So my Dr discontinued that medicine and started me on Latuda 40mg. The medicine worked very well with my mood swings and insomnia. It wasn&#039;t until the past couple weeks that I haven&#039;t been able to sleep anymore. So my Doctor decided to increase my dosage to 80mg. I&#039;m on night one but its 4:30am and still not sleeping. I&#039;m also on Depakote and Lexapro.""",7,21-Jul-12,25
Latuda,Schizophrenia,"""After a casual conference with the people arguing in my head, we decided to give Latuda a try.  My first 20mg pill went down my esophagus without any problems whatsoever.  I have high hopes for this drug therapy.  Blessed Be.""",10,5-Sep-15,29
Latuda,Schizoaffective Disorde,"""Great medicine!  I have tried Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Trazadone, and more... and landing on Latuda was a blessing.  Between it in the evening and Lamictal in the morning, I am right as rain.  Only complaint is the nausea - but this can be avoided by drinking strong lemon water with the 350 calories you must consume along with your dose.  And avoid any foods or herbs or teas that interact with the CYP3A4 liver enzyme, to stay liver and heart healthy.  That&#039;s it!""",9,2-Jan-13,40
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have Bipolar depression, schizo effective disorder and PTSD with lots of anxiety. I have been on probably all of the antipsychotics and Latuda is the best so far. I take Klonopin and Viibryd as well.  I also have diabetes which makes it hard to find the right medication as most antipsychotics raise your sugar. Latuda has not raised my sugar. I have even lost 20 lbs. The only thing I don&#039;t like about Latuda is it makes me feel weak. I have been on for 6 months now. I have no appetite most of the time which in turn makes my sugar drop to low. I do feel more normal on this but I wish there was something even better. I have the card to get Latuda for only 25.00 if you have insurance.""",8,8-Nov-14,40
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Been on latuda for 6 weeks and seen no  improvement with my depression. Still have suicidal thoughts and zero energy.""",1,8-Dec-15,14
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I took Latuda 40 mg for a week and then 80 the next week. I had to stop halfway through week 2 because I wasn&#039;t sleeping and I was feeling more agitated. Actually, it made my bipolar worse. I was up and down and up and down within a matter of minutes. """,1,6-Dec-12,47
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""This med did nothing for my Bipolar 1 disorder. It&#039;s very expensive if you do not have medical coverage""",1,9-Jun-15,18
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I took this, started at 60 mg. Caused severe restlessness and lack of sleep. Felt like I had tachycardia going on but didn&#039;t. switched down to 30 mg without doctors consent and don&#039;t get restless or have the feeling in my chest as bad. It&#039;s been a little over a week wish I had better idea on if it&#039;s working or not.""",5,23-Sep-14,52
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Started Latuda several months ago.  I couldn&#039;t be happier.  This medication is changing my life ( years of instability).  Up to 80mg daily.  The only side effect I notice is weight loss; which is fine by me.""",10,15-Oct-16,44
